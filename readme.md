Sports Personalities Classification Project

In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities into five categories: Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Virat Kohli, Roger Federer, and Lionel Messi.

Folder Structure:
- UI: Contains the UI website code.
- server: Python Flask server.
- model: Contains the Python notebook for model building.
- google_image_scrapping: Code to scrape Google for images.
- images_dataset: Dataset used for our model training.

Technologies Used:
1. Python: Core programming language.
2. NumPy and OpenCV: Utilized for data cleaning.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed for data visualization.
4. Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Used for model building.
5. Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm: IDEs utilized for development.
6. Python Flask: Employed for HTTP server.
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Utilized for the UI development.

How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the 'model' directory and execute the Python notebook for model building.
3. Use the 'google_image_scrapping' scripts to scrape Google for images of the sports personalities.
4. Install required packages using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
5. Run the Flask server in the 'server' directory to deploy the model for inference.
6. The UI in the 'UI' directory provides a user interface for interacting with the classification system.
